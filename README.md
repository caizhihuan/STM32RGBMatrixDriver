STM32RGBMatrixDriver
====================

Learning C and STM32 Programming by Example: RGB Matrix Driver. 

Right now not much to see here. I am currently getting into C and STM32 development. I like to pick a small project
as a practical exercise, even if there are better implementations out there already. So if you are looking for an efficient 
RGB Matrix Driver running on a STM32 Platform - better keep on looking. But if you want to peek over my shoulder and see what
n00bish mistakes I make - be my guest.

##Status:
- [x] 24 Bit Framebuffer
- [x] Gamma correction support
- [x] Basic UART support
- [ ] Uploading framebuffer via UART
- [ ] Basic command(line) parser to tweak runtime parameters via UART
- [ ] Doublebuffering
- [ ] ESP8266 support
