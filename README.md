STM32RGBMatrixDriver
====================

Learning C and STM32 Programming by Example: RGB Matrix Driver. 

Right now not much to see here. I am currently getting into C and STM32 development. I like to pick some exercise 
via a small project, even if there are better alternatives already out there. So if you are looking for an efficient 
RGB Matrix Driver running on a STM32 Platform - better keep on looking. But if you want to peek over my shoulder and see what
n00bish mistakes I make - go ahead.
